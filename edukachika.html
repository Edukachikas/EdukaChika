<p>Based on your audience analysis, choose a streaming category/type that is appropriate to the topic.
 
As per the answers in the survey, JHS students would much prefer a study live stream wherein each member would test out a study habit/ practice popular on TikTok, and using those study methods, each member will study the same topic, and by the end of it, the group will have a quiz regarding the topic studied, in order to see what method is more effective.
 
     We are not, however, closing our doors to other types of streaming content– such as interviews, and just chatting with our audience about  school-related things, etc…

 <p class="w3-center"><em>B. Using The Empathize Stage In The Design Thinking Process<br> </em></p>
 <p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>
 1.) Use the techniques in the Empathize stage of the Design Thinking Process to find a need of viewers in the streaming category that you chose.
<br><br>2.) Maximize the different techniques of the empathize stage.
<br><br>3.) Use the methods of basic research to identify the reason why people of different ages, statuses, beliefs, etc. watch the streams they watch.
<br><br>4.) You can perform research, interview people, and even perform surveys, just make sure that it will not require you to go out of the house.
 
<center><b>SHARING EXPERIENCES  AND OPINIONS</b></center><br>
People, most specifically, Junior High School students watch study sessions, because the thought of someone “studying with you” keeps them company and makes them comfortable. Based on the interviews conducted via gmeet calls with some of the respondents:
<center><img src = "interview.png"width="750" height="550"></center>
<br><p>As per one of the respondents: She chose live study sessions because she would want to see if TikTok study tips were truly effective, and she would want us to serve as testers. She finds watching live study sessions fun because it motivates her to study with the live streamers.
<br><br>In addition, another interviewee had also mentioned that <i>Studystreams bring me comfort—I kinda feel like I'm with friends studying in a cafe. Plus, I really like the fact that your group is gonna be studying differently, and I think it's pretty exciting!</i></p>
<br><br>
<center><b>CHARACTERISITCS OF A GOOD STREAM</b></center><br>
<p>
   <br> <b>To execute a quality </b>-worthy streaming, a creator needs to exhibit a number of attributes. Here are some characteristics:
 
<br><br><b>Presentable streamer</b> - Making a good first impression always starts with appearance! To increase views, it is essential to do this. One gains a lot of self-confidence and speeds up the development of his career by maintaining a respectable physical appearance and using proper etiquette. It's crucial to keep your content open to all audiences since we must also be conscious that the age range of our visitors may vary.
 
<br><br><b>Ability to create good content</b> - People are more inclined to visit your channel if you your contents  with higher skill. People will be interested in seeing more if you pull off an outstanding shot, performance and ability.
 
<br><br><b>Interesting content</b> - Look for opportunities to make jokes or call attention to anything amusing by being creative and proactive in your quest. Many outstanding streamers have become well-known by making people laugh and being amusing.
 
<br><br><b>Accessible stream</b> - Convenience for our viewers is provided via accessibility. Your channel's follower count can grow as a result of greater exposure. Accessibility will make it simpler for users to search and share live content on your channel. They will need to share your content quickly so that their friends can also see it because it necessitates rapid action.
 
<br><br><b>Regular uploads</b> - Consistency is the best strategy for getting viewers to return to your channel, thus it's advised to create a routine for when and how often you'll upload so that people will know when to watch your live streams.
 
<br><br><b>Engaged with viewers/other streamers</b> - Since many viewers prefer a more personal relationship with you than merely watching the streamer, engagement with viewers is crucial. Try to work with other streamers to increase your chances of being noticed or discovered because both of your viewers and theirs may be interested in you.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3 class="w3-center" id="q2"><b>WHAT'S OUR CONTENT?</b></h3>
<br>
<p> The group started this quarter off by choosing which streaming tools were necessary. The picture below is a venn diagram the group used in debating what streaming tool was best. It was boiled down to the decision of OBS or Twitch Studios. 
After assessing the differences, and similarities between our 2 chosen streaming software: OBS and Twitch Studios, we opted to go for OBS. It has more capabilities, and it is perfect for the group to use for streaming. The OBS Software includes a wide range of plug-in support. It is flexible and has direct integration with a variety of streaming platforms.
Since the software is free, the startup costs little to nothing. Because it is very flexible and multi-platform, we can deploy it to a broad range of devices as needed without having to worry about licensing.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF A MEMBER</b>
<p>Furthermore, a  member is already familiar with OBS and has used it for a year now. He testified that it was beginner-friendly.
    <center><img src = "WHY OBS.png"width="800" height="450"></center>
    <br>
    Furthermore, streaming equipment to be used for recording would be a device of a member, see  the specs of the device below:<br>
    1.) Ryzen 5 3400G<br>
    2.) 16GB RAM DDR4<br>
    3.) 120GB SSD and 500GB HDD<br>
    4.) AMD Radeon Vega 11 Graphics (GPU)<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>The streaming platform to bee used would be YouTube, this is the group’s Channel:

    <br>
    Of course, with the channel having study streams as the category, the topics would revolve around studying. But, with an interesting twist! The group will be testing out which study method popularized in the sub-community (in TikTok) “StudyTok” are effective.</p>

<center><b>STREAM TIMELINE</b></center><br>
    <p>In the streaming outline, the group created a storyboard to perfectly visualize the flow of the stream. See the images below: 
The stream will be divided into three main parts:<br>
a.) Pre-Stream<br>
b.) Mid-Stream (Pre-Study)<br>
c.) Post-Study Sesh<br>
<br>
<center><b><em>a. Pre-Stream</center></em></b>

<div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
    <p>10 minutes before the camera roles the team would check their camera quality, screen share quality,  and audio quality. This portion may be extended or shortened depending on the difficulty of the problem shoot.</p>

<div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
    <p>This screen will be flashed for the first 5 minutes of the stream for idle time to gain viewers. The group will be playing copy-right free music for the audience to be entertained while idling.</p>
</div>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<center><b><em>b. Mid-Stream/Pre-Quiz</center></em></b>
<br>
<center><img src="2.png" width="850" height="500"></center>
<p>After the pre-stream, the group will now be entering into the “Mid-stream”, this phase is also called the “pre-quiz”-- In this portion of the stream, the group will be greeting the viewers, briefly introducing the purpose of EdukaChika, introducing the members, and having a quick watch of everyone’s pre-recorded mini vlogs (the vlogs would be around 3-5 minutes long). The vlog will be containing the experience of the members with studying the topic in a whole different study method from what they are used to. After the watching of mini-vlogs, the group would then have a pre-interview, wherein the following questions would be asked:<br>
1.) “What did you find challenging about the study method assigned to you?”<br>
2.) “How did you feel about the topic being studied?”<br>
3.) “Are you ready for the 15-minute quiz?”<br>
Note that more questions may be asked, but these are the main questions that the group should answer.</p>
<br>
<img src="3.png" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Mid-Stream" width="400" height="222">
<div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
    <p>Once those questions have been answered,
The group will immediately proceed to take
The 15-minute quiz, simultaneously someone
from the group will be screen-sharing a timer
To maintain punctuality. 

The quiz may be held via  Quizziz, Kahoot, or 
Google forms.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><em>c. Post-Study Sesh</center></em></b>
<br>
<center><img src="4.png" width="850" height="500"></center>
<br>
<p>The members would all be sending their respective scores to the group chat created, one member would screenshare all of the results. After the scores have been showed, members will exammine who the highest scorer is, and members would be asking the following to the highest scorer:<br>
    <br>
1.) “What were your thoughts during the quiz?”<br>
2.) “Would you recommend this  study method to other JHS students in hopes of improving their study habitt?”<br>
3.) “On a scale of 1-10 how effective was this study method for you?”<br>
4.) “What considerations did you take when using this study method?” (For example:: The highest scorer used the Pomodoro method in studying, the member must’ve considered the time, and hours that  they are most active in studying in.)<br>
<br>
Shortly after those questions have been answered by the member, the group will proceed to have an interview with everyone in the group. The questions to be asked would be about the topic that was quizzed, discussions and rating of study methods, and thoughts about the stream. Furthermore, this would be a good time for the group to interact with the audience, and ask them questions as well.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img src="5.png" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Post-Stream" width="500" height="333"></center>
<p>After that, the group will proceed to their outros.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="6.png" width="850" height="500"></center>
<p> The stream will be no more than 1 hour.</p>

<h2 class="w3-center" id="q3"><b>STREAM ANALYSIS</b></h2>
<br>
<b><em>I.  Summary of Stream</em></b>
<p>The stream centered around studying. Specifically, it focused on the effectiveness of various study methods that are well-known online, particularly on the TikTok platform.</p>
<br>
<p>The group conducted a live stream on YouTube, the group started their live at 11:00AM, but the official start was around 11:05 AM. The stream ended at exactly 12:25N.</p>
<br>
<p>Prior to the stream starting– one member of the team assigned all the members a study habit popularized on Tiktok, to follow. Then, the team was asked to film themselves while studying the materials given to them– the topic of the exam focused on Greek mythology, Psyche and Cupid, in line with Valentine’s day fast approaching. The group took the exam as a whole. </p>
<center><img src="educhika.png" width="750" height="450"></center>
<center><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmFAwWN0nOtF_kq3SBi-95ts31m5t_yC/view?usp=share_link\">Appendix A:Timelapse of Quiz</b></center></a>
<br>
<p> During the whole stream, the group stuck with the original storyboard timeline <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/183lZ97-z5jXpdLYqJ_AFuPfsdylqlINeHxtU-bhSp_A/edit?usp=share_linkhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/183lZ97-z5jXpdLYqJ_AFuPfsdylqlINeHxtU-bhSp_A/edit?usp=share_link">(Appendix B)</a></b>. The group started out by greeting the audience, and occasionally shouting out viewers– the group then proceeded with mentioning the giveaways to hook the audience (one-hundred pesos for two viewers that followed the criteria).</p>
<br>
<p>The group proceeded with the discussion of the study methods assigned to each group member. Then, the group watched the “Appendix B”, wherein a timelapse was shown of the group showing off their study methods, and taking the exam as a whole. Furthermore, the group has discussed some questions with regards to the quiz– “How easy was the quiz?”, “What problems did you encounter?”, were some of the questions included in the “post-interview”.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are the screenshots of the team’s individual scores: <b><a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFZxRf35PI/9P-oyOdVpNloAvHmuRe2OQ/edit?utm_content=DAFZxRf35PI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">Appendix C.</a></b>
The highest scorer was Sofia Bianca, a visual learner, and  she got tasked with learning through the ”Blurting technique”. Then, the viewers that won the giveaway were Sarisha Ortega, and Angelika Juanillo.</p>
<br>
<p>After the entirety of the stream, the team asked the viewers to answer a short feedback survey.</p>

<b>ENGAGEMENT SUMMARIZATION</b>
<p>The livestream had garened over one hundred ninety one-views. The group had the most viewers coming from the google mails, and the Facebook posts the group had been sharing.</p>
<center><img src="figure 2.png" width="750" height="450"></center>
<center><em><p>Figure 2: External sites or apps where viewers found the stream</p></em></center>
<br>
<p>The group had three hundred thirteen (313) impressions, and a 5.4% impression click-through rate. Therefore, only sixteen (16) of the three hundred thirteen (313) viewers viewed the group’s live stream. The group had thirty-three viewers since the stream was published. Twenty-one (21) is the peak viewers that the group had. Lastly, the group peaked at the six-minute mark, wherein the mention of a two–hundred peso giveaway was being awarded to two viewers.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>II.  What Went Well</em></b>
<br>
<p>Days before the stream was set in motion, the team did an excellent job of promoting the scheduled live stream using Edukachika's social media platforms. (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube). Countdown posters were continuously uploaded in order to garner an audience. The flow of the stream was neatly organized and discussed beforehand. With that, all of the presenters understood what needed to be done.</p>
<br>
<p>A dry run was successfully completed a few hours before the official stream. In the course of that time, a technical member checked the entire stream layout structure to guarantee that it worked as intended in the broadcasting program utilized. Each team member also took this time to ensure that their audio and camera were functioning properly.</p>
<br>
<p>After the meticulous preparation of the aforementioned live stream, the broadcast began at the planned hour. All segments were delivered in accordance with the storyboard timeframe. Begin by greeting the audience, introducing the members, and providing a brief overview of Edukachika and the activities that will take place during the event.</p>
<br>
<p>The documentary video comprises footage of each member studying using their designated study method and the whole group answering the quiz was presented on the screen. Then after, as per the request of the audience, the scores of each participant was revealed, which served as a checkpoint for each participant's overall experience and a determination of whether or not the study methods they undertook were successful.</p>
<br>
<p>The group played a family feud game with the theme of love to close off the stream and awarded cash rewards to the audience winners. Thereafter, farewells were said and the steam ended.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>III.  Missed Opportunities</em></b>
<br>
<p> A sudden problem with the tech's connection occurred halfway through the
stream, causing the stream to lag and eventually coming to an end visually. The team decided to stop the stream even though it could still be heard and continue the giveaway through Google Meet, where most of the viewers joined as well. If only there hadn't been any technical issues, the stream would have ended without problem.</p>
<br>
<p>In accordance with what actually occurred, the group lost the chance to continue the entire segment of the stream. Taking into account that the problem arose before the interview was complete.</p>
<br>
<p>It was noticed a little bit too late because apparently the stream had been lagging for some time before it froze. Considering that their team consisted of just one technical person—who was also the one streaming, adjusting the layout, and managing everything online. The technical person had been having connection issues because of handling everything on his own, which led to the stream completely breaking down.</p>
<br>
<p>The team did not have a backup plan in case what happened occurred, which indicates that they did not anticipate any problems with their stream. The stream would have gone smoothly if the team had chosen to double the number of their technical team and had thought ahead to a backup plan just in case</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>IV. Stream Analysis</em></b>
<br>
<p>The members of Educhika strived to get the most viewers possible. It centered around a group of people who are close to their age: including classmates, schoolmates, and close friends. The strategy by the group was to spread the news to different and multiple group chats/audiences. These group chats were under the school’s name, as it is group chats of schoolmates. Moreover, the group didn’t end their gathering of viewers there; with the use of their platforms, they maximize their potential by promoting their very own stream. Examples are posting their allotted date and time of their stream (Facebook and Instagram), and each member promoting their stream using their own personal account.</p>
<br>
<p>The livestream had garened over one hundred ninety one-views. The group had the most viewers coming from the google mails, and the Facebook posts the group had been sharing</p>
<center><img src="figure 2.png" width="700" height="400"></center>
<center><em><p>Figure 1:External sites or apps where viewers found the stream</p></em></center>
<br>
<p>The group had three hundred thirteen (313) impressions, and a 5.4% impression click-through rate. Therefore, only sixteen (16) of the three hundred thirteen (313) viewers viewed the group’s live stream. The group had thirty-three viewers since the stream was published. Twenty-one (21) is the peak number of viewers that the group had. Lastly, the group peaked at the six-minute mark, wherein the mention of a two–hundred peso giveaway was being awarded to two viewers.</p>

    <center><em><p>Figure 4:AGE DEMOGRAPHIC OF RESPONDENTS</p></em></center>

    <center><em><p>Figure 5: RELATIONSHIP OF RESPONDENTS TO STREAMERS</p></em></center>
    <br>
<p>57.1% of the respondents were classmates and 42.9% were friends of the streamer. The group cascaded the stream link on social media, and the group also cascaded this information to their classmate via foot trafficking,  and with the use of Google chat.</p>
<center><img src="figure 6_ NEW INFORMATION TO THE RESPONDENTS.png" width="500" height="350"></center>
    <center><em><p>Figure 6: NEW INFORMATION TO THE RESPONDENTS</p></em></center>
    <br>
    <p>0 respondents (0%) had answered “1”, meaning none of the information from the stream was new to them.<br>

1 respondent (14.3%) had answered “3”, meaning HALF of the information from the stream was somewhat new to them.<br>
2 respondents (28.6%) have answered “4”, meaning MOST of the information from the stream was new to them.<br>

    <center><em><p>Figure 7: GRAPH OF WHEN RESPONDENTS WOULD APPLY THE LEARNED INFORMATION</p></em></center>
    <br>
    <p>All of the respondents agreed that you can use this streaming information immediately. A plausible explanation for this immediate use is because of the fact that most of the group’s viewers are students, and therefore these study habits may help them out a lot.</p>
    <br>
    <center><img src="figure 8.png" width="500" height="350"></center>
    <center><em><p>Figure 8: GRAPH OF HOW MUCH THE RESPONDENTS WOULD WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER EPISODE OF THE LIVE STREAM</p></em></center>
    <br>
    <p>85.7% of the respondents answered “Yes”, while 14.3% were “No”.  1 respondent answered no, and this may be due to the fact that the group had encountered a technical issue in the midst of the stream. However, EdukaChika is improving with every mistake made. 6 respondents answered “Yes”, this is due to the fact that the team engages with the audience, continually shouts them out, and gives prizes.</p>
    <br>
    <center><img src="figure 9.png" width="500" height="350"></center>
    <center><em><p>Figure 9: KNOWLEDGE OF STREAMERS IN THE TOPIC</p></em></center>
    <br>
    <p>All the respondents answered 100% Excellent rate to the streamer's knowledge.
 The group had researched their study plans beforehand, and the fact that the group is composed of students makes the study habits on “StudyTok‘ even more applicable, and relevant to them.  ThereforeTherefor, the group knows most of the information that they are talking about, because they have learned and applied this in real life.</p>
 <br>

    <center><em><p>Figure 10: Data according to “Do you find this streaming content relevant to address solutions, issues or challenges in our  lives.”</p></em></center>
    <br>
    <p>85.7% of the respondents answered “Yes” while 14.3 answered “Maybe”.
Most have answered “Yes'' due” due to the fact that many students come across issues in their studies. Many students are not aware of what study method is appropriate for them. A modern issue that EdukaChika is trying to solve is the Legitimacy of information on the internet, and weather study methods popularized on TikTok do work, and if it does, how would it affect the academic performance of junior high school students?</p>

    <b><em>V. Conclusion:Why did EdukaChika gain 191+ views in their stream?</em></b>
    <br>
    <p>There are numerous reasons as to why the team’s viewership was successful. Here are some of the reasons as to why the team has garnered such number of viewers</p>
    <br>
    <em> A. The streamers themselves</em>
    <p>With the member’s individual fun, quirky, and energetic personalities, it was no shock that their live stream has garnered over one-hundred ninety one views, since it was last streamed. With the personalities of each member, the team got to interact with the audience frequently and spontaneously.</p>
    <em> B. Visuals  and layout of the stream</em>
    <p> Along with the members themselves, the visuals and the layout of the stream was cute, and bubbly, which the team strongly believes  could also be a benefactor as to why the stream  has garnered so many views.</p>
    <em> C. Interest of  the viewers in the topic</em>
    <p>Another reason could be the mere  fact that the viewers themselves were interested in knowing whether study methods on Tiktok are truly effective for each member with different learning styles.</p>
    <em> D. Advertising</em>
    <p>Lastly, another benefactor as to why the stream has garnered views was due to the fact that the advertising was on point. The team has greatly put in effort in promoting the stream, and foot-trafficking. Especially with the promotion of a one-hundred peso giveaway to two  viewers.</p>
    <center><img src="sample advert.png" width="350" height="400"></center>

    <center><em><p>Figure 21:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QLmGk3VWlFA?feature=share">Screenshot of livestream on Youtube</a></p></em></center>
    <br>
    <p>Overall, the team has really enjoyed their live stream, and is looking forward to the next stream. Using the mistakes of the last stream– the team will use it to effectively create a better stream. The team thanked their viewers for joining, and for supporting EdukaChika.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The  group had a post-stream meeting. Each member mentioned how they felt about the stream–One member from the group, Ester Rahcel, had mentioned that: “I really liked the entire stream and how active the viewers were; I loved how both the streamers and the viewers share the same enthusiasm. As previously said, the streamers' personalities or the streamers themselves are the reason for the relationship. The viewers were really pleased with what our group has accomplished; they liked the overall flow of the program and how the group transformed it into a very interactive and engaging stream. We were surprised by the amount of excitement and support from the audience, and we thoroughly loved it!”</p>
    <br>
    <p>The team has yet to conclude the most effective study habit of each learner, until then, the team continues to study and strive for accuracy, and for authenticity.</p>

     <b>ENGAGEMENT SUMMARIZATION</b>
     <p>The livestream had garened over one hundred ninety one-views. The group had the most viewers coming from the google mails, and the Facebook posts the group had been sharing.</p>
     <center><img src="shot_51.png" width="750" height="500">
        <br>
        <em>Figure 2: External Sites or Apps Where Viewers Found the Stream</em>
     </center>
     <br>
     <p>The group had three hundred thirteen (313) impressions, and a 5.4% impression click-through rate. Therefore, only sixteen (16) of the three hundred thirteen (313) viewers viewed the group’s live stream. The group had thirty-three viewers since the stream was published. Twenty-one (21) is the peak viewers that the group had. Lastly, the group peaked at the six-minute mark, wherein the mention of a two–hundred peso giveaway was being awarded to two viewers.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4><b>II. WHAT WENT WELL</b></h4>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith a lot of planning, and loads of dedication–the group set out on an adventure! The adventure being going to the house of one of the members. The streamers were able to go to one location successfully, and all were safe.</p>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn comparison to the last stream– the second stream went well! There were little to  no technical issues, nor any conflict. The group had fun, and spent the whole time just learning about each other.</p>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe stream ended with a good laugh– the streamers enjoyed it, and the viewers did as well.</p>
     <br>
     <h4><b>III. MISSED OPPORTUNITIES</b></h4>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere was little to no missed opportunities– apart from the fact that the stream started a bit late. The stream ws supposed to start at around 10:30AM, however some members arrived late, therefor the stream started at 11:00AM– the streamers posted on Facebook about this, though.</p>
     <br>
     <p><b><center>Streaming Analysis</center></b></p>
     <p>The members of Educhika strived to get the most viewers possible. It centered around a group of people who are close to their age: including classmates, schoolmates, and close friends. The strategy by the group was to spread the news to different and multiple group chats/audiences. These group chats were under the school’s name, as it is group chats of schoolmates. Moreover, the group didn’t end their gathering of viewers there; with the use of their platforms, they maximize their potential by promoting their very own stream. Examples are posting their allotted date and time of their stream (Facebook and Instagram), and each member promoting their stream using their own personal account.</p>
     <p>The livestream had garened over one hundred ninety one-views. The group had the most viewers coming from the google mails, and the Facebook posts the group had been sharing.</p>

        <em>Figure 1:External sites or apps where viewers found the stream</em>
     </center>
     <p>This time, after exactly one week of doing the livestream– the group had sixty two (62) impressions, and a 12.7% impression click-through rate. Therefore, only seven (7) of the sixty two (62) viewers viewed the group’s live stream. The group had fourteen (14) views since the stream was published. Nine (9) is the peak number of viewers that the group had. Lastly, the group peaked at the four-minute mark, wherein the mention of a fifty peso gcash giveaway was being mentioned at the very beginning of the stream.</p>

     <h4><b>IV. Conclusion: Why did EdukaChika gain 62 views in their stream?</b></h4>
     <br>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are numerous reasons as to why the team’s viewership was at this number. This number is lower in comparison to the first live stream. The group suspects this is the cause since it has only been one week since the livestream, in comparison to the previous livestream wherein it was scrutinized after two months. The number of viewers would still add in the coming days. However, so far the group is considering that this as a high viewership for a one week old stream.</p>
     <br>
     <p><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere are some factors as to why the group thinks this way:</b></p>
     <ol type="A">
        <li>The streamers themselves</li>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith the member’s individual fun, quirky, and energetic personalities, it was no shock that their live stream has garnered over sixty-two views, since it was last streamed. With the personalities of each member, the team got to interact with the audience frequently and spontaneously. Furthermore, the members themselves were having loads of fun, despite talking about a topic that scares many junior high school students.</p>
        <li>Visuals  and layout of the stream</li>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis stream, the overlay has changed, so that it can be easier for the tech team to fix everything.</p>

       <p>Here are the overlays. The first overlay is the old overlay, and the second overlay is the group's current brand new overlay.</p>
       <br>
       <li>Interest of  the viewers in the topic</li>
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother reason could be the mere  fact that the viewers themselves were interested in knowing whether study methods on Tiktok are truly effective for each member with different learning styles.</p>
       <li>Advertising</li>
       <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLastly, another benefactor as to why the stream has garnered views was due to the fact that the advertising was on point. The team has greatly put in effort in promoting the stream, and foot-trafficking.</p>

    <p><b>The group is thankful that the viewers had enjoyed, and with that the stream was concluded.</p></b>
</center>
    <p>As the school year comes to an end, a good livestream is what the group needs. It looked like the group and the viewers enjoyed the stream alot. The group reflected on their whole school year, the school year went well. Another thing to mention was before the stream ended the members were asked a hypothetical scenario–  “Imagine that your future self is watching this very playback of the live stream, what would be your message to yourself ?”, the members all answered honestly, and many mentioned that they hope they are still okay in the future.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em><b>"As unbiased as possible, the group thought that the stream went well, and so did the viewers" (based on the feedback form).</b></em></p>
